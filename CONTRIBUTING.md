There are two primary ways you can contribute:

1. **Using the Issue Tracker**

   The issue tracker is the place to go for suggesting feature enhancements, reporting bugs, and asking questions. It's also a hub for connecting with project developers and other community members who share an interest in the project.

   Feel free to explore the issue tracker to find opportunities for contribution. If you spot a bug or have an idea for a feature, comment on the relevant issue indicating your intention to work on it. Then, proceed with the steps outlined below for changing the code-base.

2. **Changing the Code-base**

   When making changes to the code-base, it's best to follow these steps:

   - **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account.
   - **Make Changes**: Implement your desired changes within your forked repository. Ensure that any new code is accompanied by appropriate unit tests to validate the implemented features and check for defects.
   - **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the original repository. Be sure to provide a clear and descriptive explanation of the changes you've made.
   
   It's important to maintain consistency with the existing code-base. If the project has established stylistic or architectural guidelines, adhere to them. Otherwise, strive to mimic the existing styles and patterns.
